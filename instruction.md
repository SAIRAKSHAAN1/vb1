Project Requirements Document
1. Project Overview
The project is a high-performance vector database optimized for efficient storage, indexing, and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors. It supports Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search, metadata filtering, real-time updates, and hybrid search capabilities.
2. Technology Stack
Core Components
* Rust: High-performance backend for vector indexing and search.
* Python: Machine learning and data processing pipeline.
* JavaScript (Node.js/React.js): Frontend and API interactions.
* Docker: Containerization for microservices.
* AWS: Cloud infrastructure, including S3, EC2, Lambda, and RDS.
Databases & Storage
* PostgreSQL (with pgvector) for structured metadata storage.
* own create vector datbse or FAISS for vector indexing.
* Redis for caching frequently accessed queries.
* S3 for storing embeddings and backups.
Microservices & APIs
* gRPC for high-performance inter-service communication.
* REST API for external integrations.
* GraphQL for flexible querying.
DevOps & CI/CD
* Docker Compose & Kubernetes for container orchestration.
* Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC).
* GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
